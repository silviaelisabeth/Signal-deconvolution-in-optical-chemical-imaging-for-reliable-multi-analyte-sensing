Programming code for linear unmixing of overlapped emission spectra using hyperspectral cameras as read-out system. 
The programming code is associated to the corresponding publication


The jupyter notebooks allow an interactive step-by-step calibration and evaluation of single- and dual-sensors by first selecting region of interest (RoIs) within the 
hyperspectral cube. 
Signal deconvolution of the overlapped emission spectra (for the dual-sensor) is achieved by linear unmixing. 

All crucial information to understand the code are provided eithin the script.
